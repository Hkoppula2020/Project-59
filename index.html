Riding horses is fun, but there are many points that you should know before you start to ride. First of all, you should learn how to care for a horse. Next, you should know how to train an unbroken horse. Finally, you can learn how to really rideFirst of all, you should learn how to care for the horse before you ride. When you have a horse, you need to feed it and give it fresh water every morning and night. You also should get in the habit of grooming at least every other day, if not every day. You should get a soft bristled brush, a stiff bristled brush, a curry comb, a hoof pick, and a mane and tail comb. These should all be used when grooming. Also, you should try to keep the flies off of your horse by using fly spray.Another very important point about riding horses is training. You cannot ride an untrained horse. The most crucial part of training starts as soon as the foal is born, bonding. To have a good relationship with your horse you need to bond with him or her. You can create this bond by caring for your horse and spending a lot of time with him or her. Grooming can also help to create this bond with your horse. After you have a good bond with your horse, (which can take a while), you should break your horse in. Breaking a horse is when you train him or her to carry a saddle and/or rider. To break in a horse you can, carefully, toss a saddle blanket onto the horses back. After the horse will allow you to do that easily, you can put a saddle on the same way. The horse will probably buck the saddle off the first few times, but just keep trying until he or she figures out that it won't hurt them. Next, you should teach your horse riding etiquette. To teach your horse this, you should just practice riding and reinforce what you want your horse to do.
